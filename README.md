Frankly, I see it as a testament to the reality that as data scientists and developers, regardless of how ingenious we believe ourselves to be at the time, we'll invariably find ourselves revisiting the same project after a few years. 
By that time, we will have accumulated a substantial set of new skills, tools, and knowledge, making our previous work appear naive.
